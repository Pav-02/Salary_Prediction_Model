# Employee Salary Prediction using ML
This project predicts employee salaries using a Random Forest Regression model. It covers data preprocessing, model training, tuning, evaluation, and deployment using Streamlit.

## Problem Statement
Build a machine learning model that predicts employee salary based on inputs like Age, Experience, Education, Gender, and Job Role. The goal is to support HR departments and job seekers in estimating fair compensation.

## Technologies Used
- Python (PyCharm)
- pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, joblib
- streamlit (for deployment)

## Methodology
- Load and preprocess dataset
- Train model using Random Forest
- Tune hyperparameters
- Analyze feature importance
- Cross-validate for accuracy
- Evaluate and save model
- Deploy with Streamlit

## How to Run
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Pav-02/Salary_Prediction_Model.git
cd Salary_Prediction_Model
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
